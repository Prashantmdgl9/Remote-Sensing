# Remote-Sensing

#### Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, remains covered with ice most of the time; Most of the population lives in around Nuuk - the capital city. During summers some vegetation appears in the form of green cover. In this work, we will take the entire area of Nuuk and analyse its green cover during the summer months.
