# Remote-Sensing

Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, remains covered with ice most of the time; Most of the population lives in around Nuuk - the capital city.

During summers some vegetation appears in the form of green cover. 

In this work, we will take the entire area of Nuuk and analyse its green cover during the summer months.

### The following factors were kept in mind while designing this work:


1. Learn how to download the data from free resources
2. What python libraries are available for satellite image analysis
3. Get acquainted with the vocabulary
4. Run a real-life scenario on the data downloaded. In this case, we will check the green cover in Greenland using NDVI.
